# Nuntii
Complete rebuild of my long-term CMS project, the somewhat abandoned construction site of which is currently located at http://obbog.net.
This new approach will use classes to create a much more programmer- and user-friendly environment instead of the piles of includes and other atrocities found in the previous version.
In a way, it'll be version 2.0 of software that never even left the nest.
